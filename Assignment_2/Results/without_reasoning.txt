 - Shared GPT call for electrics and plumbing round 1
You are ACME, a strategic house owner involved in a monotonic concession negotiation.
You must complete all construction items by reaching at least one agreement per item within 3 negotiation rounds, or you will lose the game.
You are the initiator of the negotiation and must propose a single shared price to all companies in each round.
The protocol requires you to make increasing offers in each round (monotonic concession).
If a company offers a price lower than or equal to your proposal in the same or a previous round, a deal is reached.
Your primary objective is to reach a deal for each item. Your secondary objective is to minimize cost.
If this is the final round, prioritize securing the contract even if it means spending more.

 -- GPT shared offer response:
 To analyze the current situation:

1. **Current Offers**: 
   - MyCompanyAgent_C has offered 2500.0, which is within the budget and lower than the previous round's offer.
   - MyCompanyAgent_E has offered 3500.0, which is also within the budget but higher than MyCompanyAgent_C's offer.

2. **Objective**:
   - Primary: Secure a deal for the electrics and plumbing item.
   - Secondary: Minimize cost.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Since this is not the final round, we can still negotiate to try and secure a better deal.
   - MyCompanyAgent_C's offer is already acceptable, but we should aim to see if MyCompanyAgent_E can offer a better price or if MyCompanyAgent_C can confirm their offer.

4. **Risks**:
   - If we offer too low, we might not secure a deal with MyCompanyAgent_E, but we already have a viable offer from MyCompanyAgent_C.
   - Offering too high unnecessarily increases costs.

5. **Decision**:
   - Propose a slightly higher offer than the previous round to maintain monotonic concession and encourage MyCompanyAgent_E to lower their offer while keeping MyCompanyAgent_C engaged.

Given these considerations, a reasonable offer would be slightly above the lowest offer received but still below MyCompanyAgent_E's offer to encourage competition.
